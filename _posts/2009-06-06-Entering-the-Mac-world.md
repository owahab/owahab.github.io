After a long time of comparing Notebooks and Netbooks, I decided to buy a MacBook from Apple. I must say it feels a lot comfortable than GNOME, as stylish as KDE, much stable than Ubuntu and a heart full of BSD. I quickly installed most of the stuff I needed for my daily stuff, migrated my stuff from my last Linux laptop, got few things tweaked here and there and everything was as good as I wanted it. Another happy mac user.
