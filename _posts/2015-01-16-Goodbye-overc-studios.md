A year and a half ago, I left Raya to start a new business with Yousef Osman 
and Chris Miller.

I have had already joined few startups at different stages but OverC Studios 
was the first time I start from scratch.

I made a lot of mistakes, learnt a lot of lessons. Most of these lessons are
already mentioned in the great book "The Lean Startup" by Eric Reis. I highly 
recommend the book for everyone working for a startup, not just founder.

#### Few lessons I learnt:

##### 1. Be aggressive:

Approach your ideas using the most straightforward way. Fail fast or succeed
fast.

##### 2. Ship before you're ready:

Another very common mistake was trying to ship something that we are not 
ashamed of.
Lesson learnt: if you are not ashamed of your product then you probably 
haven't built anything.

##### 3. Recruit the right team:

One of the few things we did right was hiring the right team. For a startup in
this early stage, we needed a team that can pivot fast, learn a lot and build
things that we weren't sure how their final status would be.


##### 4.Identity:

I can't emphasize on the importance of your company identity.
Don't waste your time trying to be everything for everyone.
We wasted a lot of time trying to get services and build products and that time
was very dear.


It has been a great journey and I truly enjoyed every day of it. 
Goodbye OverC Studios.
