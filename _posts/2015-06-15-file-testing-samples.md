I often need sample files to test my code. Somtimes I need more specific files like a small MP4 file or a large PNG file, etc.
Instead of Googling, I collect samples that I think may help you.

The files can be accessed directly via URL:
  
    http://owahab.github.io/downloads/samples/{file}

The list of samples can be found here:

Enjoy!
