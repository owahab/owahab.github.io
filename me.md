## Profile
A friendly geek, a serial entrepreneur and a veteran hacker.

By day, I'm a full stack software engineer with over 13 years of experience specialized in web application development using Open Source technologies such as Ruby on Rails, NodeJS and PHP. I strive to use the best technology to get the job done.

By night, I hangout with my wife and 3 beautiful kids or with friends where we play PES, table tennis and chess.
